RECLAIMING COASTAL RESILIENCE THROUGH COLLECTIVE PLANNING
This is a policy brief aims to reach a more sustainable coastal resilience by mutually enhancing socio-economic system and natural system. A bottom-up approach through Kampung Cooperatives is important to complement primary measures.
The brief will facilitate and engage Kampung Cooperatives to produce a project list alongside its Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA). The Project List and CBA is a planning document collectively produced by the local, and will be used to engage both private and public sector to contribute through various means.
